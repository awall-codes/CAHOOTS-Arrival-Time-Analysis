# How Promptly Does CAHOOTS Arrive Based on Call Priority & Van Availability? 

Anna Wallin's project for ADS4SJ led by Professor Rori Rohlfs.

## Context for Research 

- The following research will investigate the mobile response team Crisis Helping Out on the Streets (CAHOOTS) which has served the Eugene/Springfield, Oregon area.
- Anecdotal evidence in the community suggests that CAHOOTS teams often take a long time to arrive at cases, limiting their effectiveness at serving the community.
- Is CAHOOTS still functioning as an adequate crisis response team despite the logistical constraints of only having 2 vans?


### Research question:
How does the priority of a call and the availability of the CAHOOTS team influence the CAHOOTS arrival time to a case? 


##### Dataset used 
Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) call data from Police Dept in Eugene, Oregon.


### Running the scripts

I have 5 scripts that can be used to replicate my data science process:

Preprocessing: script I used to pre-process the CAD dataset 

Arrival Time: Function to see how long it took for a CAHOOTS van to arrive to a scene

Van Availability: Function created to assess if a CAHOOTS van was available upon call time

Statistical analysis: Script I used to deploy my statistical methods to assess my data 

Statistical modelling: Script I used for my graphs/models to visually assess data
