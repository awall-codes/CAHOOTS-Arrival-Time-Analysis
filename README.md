# HOW PROMPTY DOES CAHOOTS ARRIVE BASED ON CALL PRIORITY & VAN AVAILABILITY? 
Anna Wallin's project for ADS4SJ led by Professor Rori Rohlfs.

### Overview of research questions:
How does the priority of a call and the availability of the CAHOOTS team influence the CAHOOTS arrival time to a case? 


##### Dataset used 
Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) call data from Police Dept in Eugene, Oregon.



### Running the scripts

I have 5 scripts that can be used to replicate my data science process:

Preprocessing: script I used to pre-process the CAD dataset 

Arrival Time: Function to see how long it took for a CAHOOTS van to arrive to a scene

Van Availability: Function created to assess if a CAHOOTS van was available upon call time

Statistical analysis: Script I used to deploy my statistical methods to assess my data 

Statistical modelling: Script I used for my graphs/models to visually assess data
