# How Promptly Does CAHOOTS Arrive Based on Call Priority & Van Availability? 

Anna Wallin's project for ADS4SJ led by Professor Rori Rohlfs.

## Context for Research 

- The following research will investigate the mobile response team Crisis Helping Out on the Streets (CAHOOTS) which has served the Eugene/Springfield, Oregon area.
- Anecdotal evidence in the community suggests that CAHOOTS teams often take a long time to arrive at cases, limiting their effectiveness at serving the community.
- Is CAHOOTS still functioning as an adequate crisis response team despite the logistical constraints of only having 2 vans?


### Research question:
How does the priority of a call and the availability of the CAHOOTS team influence the CAHOOTS arrival time to a case? 


##### Dataset used 
Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) call data from Police Dept in Eugene, Oregon.


### Running the scripts

I have 2 folders to follow along with my data cleaning and analysis process.

Preprocessing: Find the script I used to pre-process the CAD dataset here: [scripts](./scripts)

Data analysis: Find the script I used to analyze the CAHOOTS dataset here: [data_analysis](./data_analysis)
